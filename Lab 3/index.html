        <h3> What is Ice Cream?</h3>
        <p> Ice cream is a mixture of milk, cream, sugar, and sometimes other ingredients, frozen into a soft, creamy delight using special techniques. Ice cream has been a popular treat for hundreds of years but has only become commonplace since the widespread use of refrigeration. The exploding popularity of ice cream has led to several ice cream variations including frozen custard, frozen yogurt, and even non-dairy versions made with ingredients like coconut milk.
            <br> In the United States, ice cream must contain 10 to 16 percent milk fat. Higher milk fat ice creams generally have a smoother texture because they contain a lower amount of water and, therefore, fewer ice crystals. Ice creams with less than 10% milkfat are considered "ice milk" or more popularly, "low fat" ice cream.<br>
