                    Cavatappi is a short S-shaped pasta tube that looks similar to a small corkscrew. Its slender, spiral shape makes it great for serving with sauces, in salads, and baked in casseroles. Cavatappi works well with any sauce but pairs especially wonderfully with sauces that include vegetables and lean proteins. Some famous cavatappi recipes are pasta BLT salad, creamy bacon and leeks pasta, chicken pasta salad and any pasta casserole recipe. Cavatappi also usually has ridges around its exterior, which is great for holding on to sauces.</p>

<p>Cavatappi originated in Southern Italy and, despite its color is made without using eggs.
