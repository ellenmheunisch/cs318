                Tortellini is a ring shaped stuffed pasta that is typically filled with meat, cheese or vegetables. Tortelloni is a larger version of Tortellini. It is a traditional pasta in the Bologna region of Italy and is often served in broth. In Italy, it is traditional to serve tortellini this way on Christmas Eve.</p>

                Tortellini is also good with cream and butter, or in a tomato cream sauce. Tortellini are very similar to Cappelletti â€“ the only difference is Cappelletti are made from squares of pasta and tortellini are made from circles and have different meat stuffing.</p>
