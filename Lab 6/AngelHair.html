     <p> Angel Hair
Angel hair pasta is a long, thin noodle with a rounded shape. Although it resembles spaghetti – another long, thin pasta – angel hair is much finer. This delicate shape is best used with simple, light sauces and vegetables, such as pesto sauce or a primavera dish. Angel hair pasta can often pair well with light seafood ingredients, such as scallops. A little goes a long way with angel hair pasta – keep dishes simple and refined, with just a few fresh ingredients.</p>

<p>While angel hair pasta is similar to capellini, angel hair is actually a bit thinner. Capellini’s diameter measures between 0.85 and 0.92 millimeters, while angel hair’s diameter is between 0.78 and 0.88.</p>
