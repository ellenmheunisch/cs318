    <h2> My Favorite Recipe</h2>
<h3>Sirloin Steak with Garlic Butter</h3>
<h3> Ingredients</H3>
<ul>
    <li>1 1/4 pounds sirloin steak I like top sirloin</li>
    <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
    <li>4 tablespoons butter softened</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon garlic minced</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon minced fresh herbs such as thyme, parsley or chives, plus more for garnish</li> </ul>
<h3> Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
    <li> Pat each steak dry with a paper towel. Heat a large cast iron skillet or other heavy pan over medium high heat.</li>
    <li>Pour the olive oil into the pan. Season the steaks on both sides with salt and pepper.</li>
<li>Place the steaks in a single layer in the pan. Cook for 4-5 minutes per side or until browned. Use a thermometer to cook the steak to your desired level of doneness. I recommend cooking to medium which is 145 degrees F.</li>
<li>While the steak is cooking, place the butter in a bowl along with the garlic, herbs, salt and pepper. Stir to combine.</li>
<li>Let the steaks rest for at least 5 minutes off the heat. Place a dollop of butter on top of each steak. Slice the steak. Garnish with additional fresh herbs if desired, then serve.
